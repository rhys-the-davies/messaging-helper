## What this does

It's a simple chat interface powered by Claude (Anthropic's AI) that helps you create messaging to align with your brand guidelines. It reads your brand voice, tone, and messaging guidelines from markdown files and uses them to provide AI-powered writing assistance.

**Perfect for:**
- Marketing teams ensuring consistent messaging
- Customer support writing on-brand responses
- Product teams crafting aligned announcements
- Anyone who needs help staying on-brand

## Features

- ✅ **Easy Setup**: Deploy in 5 minutes with just an API key
- ✅ **Config-Driven**: All customization via `config.json` and markdown files
- ✅ **No Code Changes Needed**: Edit content, not code
- ✅ **Clean Chat Interface**: Simple, responsive UI that works everywhere
- ✅ **Streaming Responses**: Fast, real-time AI assistance
- ✅ **Private**: Your own instance, your own API key, your own data

_That said - it might not be best for you._

## When to use this vs Claude Pro/Projects

**Use Claude Pro/Projects if:**
- You're a small team (< 20 people) with easy access to their subscription services
- You need full conversation history and collaboration features
- You want zero maintenance and instant setup
- Cost isn't a primary concern ($30/user/month)

**Use this custom messaging helper if:**
- **Geographic access barriers** - Team members in regions where Claude Pro is restricted or requires a VPN
- **Payment complexity** - Setting up individual subscriptions is difficult (no corporate cards, currency issues)
- **Cost at scale** - You have 50+ users and API costs ($0.014/message) are significantly cheaper than subscriptions
- **Custom workflows** - You need specific integrations, custom UI, or a white-label deployment
- **Embedded use case** - You want to build this into your product or client deliverables - this could be a good starting point
- **Simple use case** - Your team primarily needs single-response content generation (not long conversations)

**Real-world example:** 
A textile company with 8 team members across Vietnam, Bangladesh, and China needed consistent brand messaging. Individual Claude Pro subscriptions had payment barriers and potential access restrictions. A single deployed app with one API key solved the access problem and cost ~$20/month instead of $240/month.

**Cost comparison:**

| Team Size | Claude Pro | Custom App (estimated) | Savings |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| 5 users   | $150/mo   | $10-20/mo              | ~$130   |
| 10 users  | $300/mo   | $20-40/mo              | ~$260   |
| 25 users  | $750/mo   | $50-100/mo             | ~$650   |
| 50 users  | $1,500/mo | $100-200/mo            | ~$1,300 |

*Assumes Claude Team plan at $30/user/month and ~5 messages/user/day*

## Customization Guide

### config.json

This file controls all the UI and branding:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `companyName` | Your company name (appears in header) | `"Acme Inc"` |
| `primaryColor` | Brand color in hex | `"#FF6B35"` |
| `tagline` | Subtitle under the header | `"Write content that sounds like Acme"` |
| `welcomeMessage` | Initial message from the assistant | `"I'm here to help you write on-brand content"` |
| `suggestions` | Example use cases shown on home screen | Array of `{icon, text, description}` |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "companyName": "Acme Inc",
  "primaryColor": "#FF6B35",
  "tagline": "Write content that sounds like Acme",
  "welcomeMessage": "I'm here to help you create content that matches Acme's voice and values.",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "icon": "✉️",
      "text": "Customer emails",
      "description": "Friendly and helpful"
    },
    {
      "icon": "📱",
      "text": "Social media",
      "description": "Bold and engaging"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content Files

Add markdown files to the `/content` folder. The AI reads ALL `.md` files in this folder.

**Recommended structure:**

1. **brand-voice.md** - Voice, tone, personality
   - What's your personality? (e.g., professional yet friendly)
   - Voice principles with examples
   - Words you use vs. words you avoid
   - Tone shifts by context (support, marketing, etc.)

2. **messaging-guide.md** - Core messaging
   - Mission/vision
   - Value propositions
   - How to describe your product/service
   - Target audience personas
   - Key messages by scenario

**Tips for great brand guidelines:**
- ✅ **Be specific**: "Use 'help' instead of 'assist'" beats "be simple"
- ✅ **Show examples**: Include ✅ good and ❌ bad examples
- ✅ **Be concise**: The AI reads all of it—keep it focused
- ✅ **Update regularly**: Guidelines should evolve with your brand

**Example snippet:**
```markdown
## Voice Principles

### 1. Clear, Not Clever

We value clarity over creativity. Say what you mean directly.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Start your free trial"
- ❌ "Embark on your journey to success"

### 2. Confident, Not Arrogant

We know our product works, but we don't brag.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We help 10,000 teams ship faster"
- ❌ "We're the world's #1 platform"
```

## FAQ

## Examples of Good Brand Guidelines

Want inspiration? Here are examples of clear, effective brand guidelines:

**Voice Principle Example:**
```markdown
### Human, Not Robotic

Write like a real person. Use contractions, start sentences with "And" or "But" if it sounds natural.

- ✅ "We're here to help. And we mean it."
- ❌ "We are available to provide assistance to you."
```

**Word Swap Example:**
```markdown
| ❌ Don't Use | ✅ Use Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| utilize     | use           |
| assistance  | help          |
| commence    | start         |
| request     | ask           |
```

**Tone by Context Example:**
```markdown
### For Support Emails
- Acknowledge the problem first
- Be empathetic, not defensive
- Give clear next steps
- Example: "We understand this is frustrating. Here's what we'll do..."
```
