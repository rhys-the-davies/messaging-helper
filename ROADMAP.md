## 📅 Planned (Next 3-6 Months)

### Conversation History
**What:** Save your past conversations and reference them later
**Why:** Don't lose great content you've already generated. Search and reuse previous work.
**Status:** Planned
**Complexity:** Medium

---

### Notion Integration
**What:** Sync your brand guidelines directly from Notion pages
**Why:** Many teams already keep their brand guidelines in Notion. Instead of copying content to markdown files, just point the app to your Notion workspace and it automatically pulls your latest guidelines.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more manual copying between Notion and markdown files
- ✅ Guidelines stay in sync automatically
- ✅ Marketing team updates Notion, AI instantly knows
- ✅ Single source of truth for brand guidelines

**Status:** Planned
**Complexity:** Medium
**Details:** [See GitHub Issue #1](../../issues/1) for implementation discussion

---

### Export & Share
**What:** Export conversations as markdown, PDF, or share via link
**Why:** Save great AI-generated content to your docs, share with teammates, or reference in meetings.
**Status:** Planned
**Complexity:** Easy
